Q: When call is placed through outbound trunk with force trunk cid option, then callee receive sip header P-Asserted-Identity. 
  This is caused by CONNECTEDLINE update from asterisk. CID:<OUTBOUND TRUNK CID NUMBER>
A: Go to FreePBX -> Advanced settigs and disable: 'Display CallerID on Calling Phone'


Q: Transferred call to extension, are forwarded to mobile phone. Caller ID at this moment is from First call initiator.
A: Set CID Options in trunk edit to Block foreign cid

Q: Clean call recordings with 44byte size caused by Queue
A: Add to crontab following line

0 0 * * * find /var/spool/asterisk/monitor -type f -size 44c -exec rm -f {} \;


Q: How to check who's register on pjsip extension
A: Run following command:

# cat /var/log/asterisk/full | grep res_pjsip/pjsip_configuration.c | grep -i "is now reachable."
# cat /var/log/asterisk/full | grep res_pjsip/pjsip_configuration.c | grep -i "is now unreachable."
# cat /var/log/asterisk/full | grep res_pjsip/pjsip_configuration.c


Q: When we receive error like "Module "Core" signed by an invalid key." in freepbx web page.

A: Run following command:
# /usr/bin/gpg --homedir /var/lib/asterisk/.gnupg --no-permission-warning --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve=true,timeout=10 \ 
  --key server pool.sks-keyservers.net --refresh-keys
  
  
Q: res_pjsip_transport_management.c:133 idle_sched_cb: Shutting down transport 'TCP to xxx.xxx.xxx.xx:xx' since no request was received in 32 seconds
A: This is caused by following things:
1) timer_b variable acting as timeout from last received INVITE from client
2) sip client didn't send OPTIONS as keep alive mechanism

 * The transport management module is responsible for 3 things...
 * 1.  It automatically destroys any reliable transport that does not
 * receive a valid request within system/timer_b milliseconds of the
 * connection being opened. (Attack mitigation)
 * 2.  Since it increments the reliable transport's reference count
 * for that period of time, it also prevents issues if the transport
 * disconnects while we're still trying to process a response.
 *  (Attack mitigation)
 * 3.  If enabled by global/keep_alive_interval, it sends '\r\n'
 * keepalives on reliable transports at the interval specified.
